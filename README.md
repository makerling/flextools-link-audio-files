Links Audio wavfiles to Audio Variant Writing System Lexeme Form in Fieldworks

This script links existing audio files (pronunciations) to their corresponding lexeme forms in the audio variant writing systems field. It assumes that the audio variant writing system has already been created, if not, the script will stop and prompt you to create it. The files must be in .wav format and named as their corresponding headwords. You can run this script multiple times safely, it checks if entries already have a linked file. See Fieldworks help topics for more information about how to create a variant audio writing system or further information about pronuncations and audio files: Audio files overview, Writing System Properties overview (how to add Audio Writing System)
